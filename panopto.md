Panopto is a video development platform that provides a fully integrated environment for our authors to create and share their content with Packt. 
Panopto does away with the need for authors and editors to transfer large files to and fro. 
It provides instant access to newly created video and edits, along with enabling live streaming for interactive feedback and live Author Conferencing. It also provides editors with unrivalled access to the content.

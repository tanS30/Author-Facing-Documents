<h4><font face="Franklin Gothic Book"> Now that you know everything there is to a Packt video, let's get down to recording our very own sample video! </font> </h4>
<h4><font face="Franklin Gothic Book"> You'll notice that we have 3 files other than the README: </font> </h4>

<h4 style="text-decoration: underline; color:black"><font face="Franklin Gothic Book"> 1. Script </font> : <h4><font face="Franklin Gothic Book">This document will take you through the narration that needs to be given in the video, along with how and when you need to refer to the code and PPT in support. </font> </h4>

<h4 style="text-decoration: underline; color:black"><font face="Franklin Gothic Book"> 2. PPT </font> : <h4><font face="Franklin Gothic Book">There are two PPT slides; one will serve as an introduction to the video and the other as the conclusion. </font> </h4>
<h4 style="text-decoration: underline; color:black"><font face="Franklin Gothic Book"> 3. Code </font> : <h4><font face="Franklin Gothic Book">The code snippets that are to be used are in this folder. The files are numbered as per the order in which they need to appear in the video (Demo, Demo2, and so on). </font> </h4>


<h4><font face="Franklin Gothic Book">All you need to do is use the PPT, code, and script to record a screencast with the specified settings. 

Let your editor know once you're done so that you can discuss and implement the feedback, post which we can move on to the next step in the process!</font> </h4>
